# Transloc API Server
This project wraps the Transloc API from https://market.mashape.com/transloc/openapi-1-2 and creates a sentence that can be used in applications. 

To get the project running, you need to a Mashape API key. Add that to you environment variables (follow the naming conventions in `Constants.swift`) and can make requests to /api/v1/next-arrival/:stop_id.
